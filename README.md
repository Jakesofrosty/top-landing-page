# top-landing-page
The Odin Project landing page project 
In this project I've practiced and demonstrated my ability to use flexbox and other css and html attributes and elements. I have used flexbox to create a semi responsive lay out of the containers in the webpage. This project has allowed me to reflect on and make use of my knowledge of class selectors, css specificity, and flex box properties like flex-shrink, flex-grow, and flex-basis. I've also been able to make use of flex-wrap and the gap property.  I especially enjoyed working on this project because it has allowed me to apply what I've learned and realize some concepts that I did not understand as much as I thought. I am looking forward to growing my knowledge and getting better at applying previous concepts.
